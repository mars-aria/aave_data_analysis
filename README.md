# aave_data_analysis
For a human-centered data science assignment, I analyze how Google's Perspective API tool detects and categorizes Black language data, also known as AAVE (African-American Vernacular English), from Twitter. My goal was to ascertain whether or not the Perspective API tool would flag AAVE as being toxic. I also attempted to verify if it does so at a frequency level higher than with other types of language data (i.e. expletives, racial slurs, etc.).
